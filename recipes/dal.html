        <h2 class="hh2">Description</h2>
        <p id="para">Derived from the Sanskrit word that means “to split”, dal is a collective term for pulses—lentils, peas, and beans. While sometimes used in other dishes, these pulses are usually served slow-simmered into a soft, porridge-like dish that's also called dal. It's one of the most widespread and traditional daily foods across India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, and like any dish that millions of people cook daily, dal is infinitely adaptable. The type of pulse used, the consistency of the final dish, and the seasonings will be different from region to region and house to house.</p>
